i hope all of you understand my bad english ;-)

So here we go....

I have opened the Door on OpenMQTTGateway for "i2c Bus Modules/Sensors"
but this has required to complete restructure the Pin Connections
on the NodeMCU

Why?
2 Reasons

First:
As most of us know and and 1technophile has allready written
we run out of usable pins for different boards.
So i have made some research and found out that many pins
could switched its function...
like d0 - gpio16 and d5 - gpio14
d0 could not be used for receive because it has no interrupt as i have understand
so why not use it for Sending IR ? ;-)
the d5 is free and usable for other stuff.

Second:
To Use I2C there a 2 possible ways...
1. complete re-invent the i2c software for the Board 
2. use the Wire.h that exists and work great...
But Wire.h has a small problem.. it explicit wants D1 and D2 on the ESP8266
and so i have freeded and switched the other pins..

Ended up in this:

D0 - GPIO16 # as Send Pin for IR (because IR need no interrupt)
D1 - GPIO5  # as SCL (I2C Bus) for BH1750 Light Sensor
D2 - GPIO4  # as SDA (I2C Bus) for BH1750 Light Sensor
D3 - GPIO00 # as Receive Pin for 433mhz
D5 - GPIO14 # as Receive Pin for DHT22
D8 - GPIO15 # as Send Pin for 433mhz


And all is Working ;-)


There is a another benefit for using this...
I await the next 2 Days a another i2c bus module the "BME280" a "I2C or SPI Temperature, Humidity and Pressure Sensor"

for all they dont know what this means...
the I2C bus can handle up to 8 modules on 2 wires in parallel (no more worries about free pins)
and... for thoose they have allready a DHT11 or DHT22 you can unplug it then and
we have again pin D5 free for other things ;-)

i hope you an first of all 1technophile like my work

sorry for the chaos and unstructured work but this is the first contribution 
for a project in my life... i started 3 month ago with the arduino stuff
and have no clue i have understand the git system correct how to merge code..
